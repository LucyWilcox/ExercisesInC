### Think OS Chapter 2 reading questions

For each of the reading questions below, write answers in the form of
a clear, concise, complete sentence or two.

1. Give a real-world example of virtualization (ideally not one of 
the ones in the book).  What is abstractly true about the system that
is not literally true about the implementation?

I can view any of my photos from Google Photos on my phone. The system can get any photo from Google's servers and display it on my phone, but the photos are not all literally stored on my phone.

2. What is the difference between a program and a process?

A process reresents the running program. The process contains the program text, data, input/output, and hardware state. Processes can run multiple programs but generally run one.

3. What is the primary purpose of the process abstraction? 

Abstracting processes is useful because you, the programmer, don't need to worry about many elements of the process like memory, switching between processes, and processes running on different devices within on possible between computers. 

4. What illusion does the process abstraction create?

This creates the abstraction that each program is running indepently from all other programs.

5. What is the kernel?

The kernal is a part of the OS which creates threads and core OS functions.

6. What is a daemon?

Daemon is a process that runs in the background.
